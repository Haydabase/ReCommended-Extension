# Summary

The ReCommended Extension for ReSharper augments the sophisticated code analysis engine by providing more rules not (yet) available from JetBrains. Among the most interesting features are

- detection of redundant assertions,
- inappropriate use of "async void",
- incorrect use of ReShaper annotations,
- exception analyzer (exceptions that should never be thrown or caught),
- and lots more.

The most highlightings also have quick fixes for obvious solutions.

Another feature of the extension are new context actions that simply save time for accomplishing everyday tasks, e.g. for adding ReShaper annotations, putting ".ConfigureAwait(false)", etc.
